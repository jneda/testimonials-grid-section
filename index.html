            I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
            current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
            got every penny&CloseCurlyQuote;s worth.

          “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
          I&CloseCurlyQuote;ve been looking to make a transition and have heard
          some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the
          free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
          thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time
          of my life. Since completing the course, I&CloseCurlyQuote;ve
          successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR
          startup. ”

          developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal
          attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing

          “ Before joining the bootcamp, I&CloseCurlyQuote;ve never written a
          line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help
          me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a
          former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
          program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were
          very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile
          team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to
          the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact,
          I&CloseCurlyQuote;ve often referred to it during interviews as an
          example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job
          as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100%
          recommend! ”
